#### Description:
This project focuses on the development and evaluation of machine learning and deep learning models for hate speech detection and classification on social media platforms. Hate speech poses a significant challenge in maintaining a safe and inclusive online environment, necessitating effective content moderation strategies. By leveraging various algorithms and models, we aim to build robust systems capable of accurately identifying and mitigating instances of hate speech.

#### Key Features:
- Implementation of multiple machine learning algorithms including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest Classifier.
- Integration of deep learning models such as Neural Networks, XGBoost, and Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT).
- Evaluation of model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC score.
- Exploration of different preprocessing techniques and feature engineering methods to enhance model effectiveness.
- Utilization of public datasets containing labeled hate speech data for training and testing purposes.

#### Goals:
- Develop reliable and efficient hate speech detection models to aid in content moderation efforts.
- Contribute to the creation of safer and more inclusive online communities by mitigating the spread of hate speech.
- Facilitate further research and development in the field of natural language processing and social media analytics.
